## Interpretation of Econometric Results

### Stationarity Tests (ADF)

* **Default rate**: non-stationary in levels, stationary after first differencing → integrated of order 1, I(1).
* **GDP, unemployment, inflation**: stationary in levels → integrated of order 0, I(0).

This mixed integration order (I(0) and I(1)) makes the **ARDL framework** particularly appropriate, since it can handle both types of variables without requiring full differencing of the data.

### OLS Regression

* Signs of coefficients are consistent with economic theory:

  * **GDP** has a **negative** relationship with default rates (growth reduces defaults).
  * **Unemployment** has a **positive** effect (higher unemployment → higher defaults).
  * **Inflation** shows a negative sign but is not statistically significant.
* However, OLS diagnostics highlight serious issues:

  * **Low explanatory power** (R² \~ 0.30).
  * **Residuals are non-stationary**, autocorrelated (Durbin-Watson = 0.40, Breusch-Godfrey p < 0.01).
  * **Heteroskedasticity detected** (White test p < 0.01).

➡️ Conclusion: OLS is a weak specification, unable to properly capture the dynamics of default rates.

### ARDL Model

* The ARDL(1,0,0) specification solves most of the issues observed in OLS:

  * Residuals are free from autocorrelation (Durbin-Watson \~ 1.76, Ljung-Box p > 0.3).
  * No evidence of heteroskedasticity (White test p = 0.46).
  * Significant long-term equilibrium relationship confirmed by the **Bound Test** (F-statistic >> critical values).
* Coefficient interpretation:

  * **GDP**: negative impact, both short- and long-term.
  * **Unemployment**: positive and significant.
  * **Default rate autoregression**: strong persistence (lag coefficient \~ 0.95).
* The **Error Correction Term (ECT)** is significant and negative (-0.065), indicating that after a shock the default rate gradually returns to long-term equilibrium.

➡️ Conclusion: The ARDL framework captures both short-term adjustments and long-term equilibrium relationships, making it robust for IFRS 9 forward-looking PD modeling.

### Granger Causality Tests

* **GDP → Default rate**: no evidence of short-term Granger causality.
* **Unemployment → Default rate**: evidence of causality at lag 3 (p < 0.05).
* **Inflation → Default rate**: no significant causality.

➡️ Interpretation: unemployment shocks tend to anticipate changes in default rates after a delay, confirming its predictive role for credit risk.

### Key Takeaways for the README

1. OLS confirms theoretical relationships but suffers from non-stationary residuals, autocorrelation, and low explanatory power.
2. ARDL resolves these issues, demonstrating cointegration and providing a valid econometric framework for forward-looking PD estimation.
3. Unemployment stands out as the most reliable predictor of default rates, especially in the medium term.
4. The Error Correction Mechanism ensures consistency between short-term shocks and long-term equilibrium.
