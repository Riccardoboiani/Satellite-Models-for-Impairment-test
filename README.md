## Satellite Model for IFRS 9 Impairment
In the dataset, "Tasso Default" means "Default Rate". Apologies for the legacy; I should have updated all the code, otherwise it wouldn’t work properly. The dafault rate was obtained from the Bank of Italy dataset regarding the No financial firms.

### Context and Motivation

The purpose of this project is to provide a methodological framework for the development of a **satellite model** designed to estimate the **Probability of Default (PD)** under a **forward-looking approach**, in line with the requirements of the **IFRS 9 accounting standard**.

IFRS 9 explicitly requires financial institutions to incorporate expectations about future macroeconomic conditions into credit risk parameters. This implies that models cannot rely solely on historical default rates but must also integrate **macroeconomic forecasts** to ensure that estimates of **lifetime PD** remain consistent with the expected evolution of the economic environment.

### Why a Satellite Model?

Credit risk is significantly influenced by the dynamics of the broader economy. Key macroeconomic drivers such as:

* **Gross Domestic Product (GDP)** – negatively correlated with default rates.
* **Unemployment rate** – positively correlated with default rates.
* **Inflation rate** – potentially non-linear effects, depending on the economic context.

These relationships are well documented in the academic and regulatory literature. A satellite model allows us to explicitly capture these dependencies and translate macroeconomic scenarios into credit risk parameters.

### Choice of Econometric Framework

A traditional static regression (e.g., Ordinary Least Squares, OLS) provides a first insight into the relationship between default rates and macroeconomic variables. However, such approaches are limited:

* They explain only a small portion of the variability in default rates.
* They cannot capture the **dynamic interactions** and **lagged effects** of macroeconomic shocks.

To overcome these limitations, the model relies on an **AutoRegressive Distributed Lag (ARDL)** framework.

#### Why ARDL?

The ARDL methodology offers several advantages:

* It distinguishes **short-term dynamics** from **long-term equilibrium relationships**.
* It is applicable even when time series are not fully stationary, as long as they are integrated of order zero or one (I(0) or I(1)).
* It allows for the presence of **autoregressive components** (past default rates) and **distributed lags** (past values of macroeconomic variables).
* It supports the detection of **cointegration relationships**, ensuring that the model reflects an economically meaningful long-term equilibrium.

This makes ARDL particularly well suited for credit risk modeling under IFRS 9, where both short-term volatility and long-term structural dependencies must be taken into account.

### Key Features of the Model

* Integration of **macroeconomic forecasts** (GDP, unemployment, inflation).
* Robust econometric framework that balances explanatory power with interpretability.
* Compliance with **IFRS 9 forward-looking requirements**.
* Ability to translate **macroeconomic scenarios** into **lifetime PD estimates**.

### Intended Use

This model is not intended to produce point predictions of default rates, but rather to serve as a **framework** for scenario analysis and impairment testing. It can be adapted and extended to specific portfolios, asset classes, or jurisdictions by calibrating the macroeconomic variables and default data accordingly.
